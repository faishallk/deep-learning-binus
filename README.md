# deep-learning-binus
This is my deep learning course at BINUS University and it teaches about the basics of deep neural networks, a branch of machine learning concerned with the development and application of modern neural networks. In these code, include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) multiclass classification, LSTM architecture up to Transformer architecture.
